# UNH-RVAT Reynolds number dependence experiment

This repository contains the processing and plotting code, as well as the 
derived dataset from the UNH-RVAT Reynolds number dependence experiment
performed in Spring 2014.

**Note:** This repository is still in active development and is not ready
for use.

Getting started
---------------

We recommend the 
[Anaconda Python distribution](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/)
(Python 3.4) since it includes most dependencies. The remaining 
can be installed by executing

    pip install -r requirements.txt

See `run.py` for functions to process and visualize the data.
